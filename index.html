<h1 style="float:left;">Personal Information</h1>
<p style="float:right;">My name is Heng-Chia Chang (Isaac) whose student number is 3860650 and 
email address is s3860650@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Taiwan where 
Portuguese called “Formosa”, which means, a beautiful island. Stinky Tofu, 
Pearl Milk Tea and Pig Blood Cake are the most special and unique dishes in 
Taiwan. I love playing basketball and my favorite NBA team is Los Angeles 
Lakers due to LeBron James, I am his fan since I was 7. Semester 2 2022 is 
officially my first year in RMIT University and I am excited about the new 
chapter in RMIT in Australia.</p>

<h1 style="float:left;">Interest in IT</h1>
<p style="float:right;">I am interested in Information Technology because being able to find 
out people’s behaviors by reading data and through technologies is easy 
and interesting. What do people do in their free time; for example, 
browsing websites or shopping online, watching movies or news. We can 
collect all the data through technologies. Collecting data or numbers and 
making them valuable to life attracts me a lot. I like to analyze people’s 
activities, habit or interests by using technologies. I started to get 
interest in IT when my family brought the first smartphone as my birthday 
gift, and I found that it helps faster and easier solve problems. In addition,
I can search any information online or even ask specific question on blog 
and then wait for professionals to answer.</p>

<p style="float:right;">There are a lot of fantastic universities in Melbourne, Australia and 
there are some reasons why I chose RMIT rather than other universities in 
Melbourne. Firstly, it only takes around ten minutes walking to RMIT from my 
apartment. Besides that, RMIT is ranked as one of the top ten university in 
Australia and top 400 in globe. RMIT was founded in 1887 as an historical 
university and has more than one hundred and thirty years of experience in 
teaching with many of excellent teaching staff. RMIT is also the only one 
university honored by the British Royal. Secondly, IT in RMIT is a well-known 
subject from all over the world and it is one of RMIT’s strengths. Thus, I want 
to be a part of the culture and eventually a great alumni of the university.</p>
