<h2 style="text-align: center;">Personal Information</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;My name is Heng-Chia Chang (Isaac) whose student number is s3860650 and
email address is s3860650@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Taiwan where
Portuguese called “Formosa”, which means, a beautiful island. Stinky Tofu,
Pearl Milk Tea and Pig Blood Cake are the most special and unique dishes in
Taiwan. I love playing basketball and my favorite NBA team is Los Angeles
Lakers due to LeBron James, I am his fan since I was 7. Semester 2 2022 is
officially my first year in RMIT University and I am excited about the new
chapter in RMIT in Australia.</p>

<div style="border:1px solid;clear:both;"></div>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Interest in IT</h2>
<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;">What and when interest in IT :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;I am interested in Information Technology because being able to find
out people’s behaviors by reading data and through technologies is easy
and interesting. What do people do in their free time; for example,
browsing websites or shopping online, watching movies or news. We can
collect all the data through technologies. Collecting data or numbers and
making them valuable to life attracts me a lot. I like to analyze people’s
activities, habit or interests by using technologies. I started to get
interest in IT when my family brought the first smartphone as my birthday
gift, and I found that it helps faster and easier solve problems. In addition,
I can search any information online or even ask specific question on blog
and then wait for professionals to answer.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;">Reason to RMIT :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;There are a lot of fantastic universities in Melbourne, Australia and
there are some reasons why I chose RMIT rather than other universities in
Melbourne. Firstly, it only takes around ten minutes walking to RMIT from my
apartment. Besides that, RMIT is ranked as one of the top ten university in
Australia and top 400 in globe. RMIT was founded in 1887 as an historical
university and has more than one hundred and thirty years of experience in
teaching with many of excellent teaching staff. RMIT is also the only one
university honored by the British Royal. Secondly, IT in RMIT is a well-known
subject from all over the world and it is one of RMIT’s strengths. Thus, I want
to be a part of the culture and eventually a great alumni of the university.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;">During my studies :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;I am studying in Bachelor of Information Technology,
during my three-year study I expect myself to be able to write most of programs,
applications or websites I want. Being a professional is one of my goals because
I personally think information technologies and artificial intelligence are tendencies
in the near future. This is why I have chosen Information Technology as my bachelor’s degree.
Recently, I am learning Python and I want to develop my coding skills.
I find some information about Python and Java to support my learning pathway in order to improve my coding skills.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Ideal Job</h2>
<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;"><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/57888866?type=standard#sol=899914e90f8dc5b743714f8cbd7 df540e405b15e" target="_blank">IT Manager</a> : </p>

</div>

<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;">Description :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;IT manager is the most attractive job to me so far. The core of IT manager’s responsibility is to make sure
every employee is at the correct position based on their ability and personality, dealing problems with
efficient ways which makes the company better. Furthermore, making sure all the customers and clients can get
reliable resources and fully support. IT manager observes market tendency in order to adjust the strategy because of
the technology growth and rapid-changing world. Leadership is another aspect that IT manager should possess.
Being a leader is not an easy task. IT manager needs to prove that he has the ability to be trusted by employees.
IT manager is full of challenges, and I personally like to challenge myself to see where my limit is and how
I can defeat these challenges and overcome the pressure followed by.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;">Description of the position :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;Being an IT manager should possess a ton of IT technical experience such as Architecture and Applications.
IT manager should be proficient in IOS, Windows or other operating system. IT manager must have the ability to
find out problems and solve them by making correct decision to each core issue. IT manger should be able to find out
what exactly his customers want and focus on the target customer groups instead of chasing other customers groups randomly.
Moreover, IT manager needs to analyze market’s risk in order to avoid losing a ton of money which would possibly
take company to financial crisis. One of the most important requirements is attention to details as IT manager should be
more careful than anyone else in the office. Experience is another factor required to apply for IT manager,
because experience is a great teacher.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;">Skills I have :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;Honestly, I am very far from being a good IT manager which is my ideal job. As now, I can definitely write some programs
by my own but definitely not as complete as it is required, and I am not familiar with Windows system so far.
I am very confident with attention to details because that is what I always do since I was young.
Avoiding risk is another aspect which does not bother me too much because I always take every possible result or
consequence into the consideration before and after the action. How to find out customers’ needs by using technologies
is difficult for me right now; in addition, IT technical experience such as Architecture and Applications are the area
that I have not learned before; thus, these abilities are what I really need to improve or learn in order to be better.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;">Skills I need:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;There are a ton of skills, technique and fields that I need to learn based on the skills I have. For system,
I need to be able to understand what functions or meaning in different systems and how to use them in proper time.
To improve these fields, it is necessary to try in a variety of systems in order to get better understanding and
mature skills every time I learn new functions or programs. For IT technique skills, try as much as I can to get
the knowledge; for instance, during my Bachelor career, I will try to learn new stuff other than those in the textbook
or class’s material. I would like to go to library to borrow some books about IT and try to execute them in computer
and get the outcome to see whether they are correspondent to the book’s result or theory. I have faith in myself to
avoiding risk but when thousands of data comes at the same time or in the same file, I still have possibility to
make mistakes. Based on that, I will need to improve the ability and practice frequently in case mistakes occurring.
Finding customers group is the field that I have never touched; thus, interview with someone who is expert
at this field would be the best solution. All I need to do is to follow the suggestion given and make some adjustments
through interview.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Personal Profile</h2>

</div>

<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;">Meaning :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;After completed the online Myers-Briggs test, I found that I am logistician. The result is quite match to my personality,
for example, stubborn, honest and judgment etc. The result is kind of to value myself and to prove I am on the right track
of my ideal career. By doing the Myers-Briggs test I have a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of myself and
then I can strengthen my weaknesses or drawbacks. On the other hand, I get to know more about my advantages and to
maintain them. Myers-Briggs test lets me have more time to adjust my habits to experience better in a group.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;">Behavior in a team :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;Myers-Briggs test have mentioned some weaknesses and strengths about my personality
which I can improve in the teamwork especially. It mentions that I am not a talkative person and I am not good at drawing
attention. With this, my ideas might be ignored by other teammates or crew members. It also talks about that logistician
is the most careful and likely personality type to avoid risk or to come up with an idea to an unpredictable situation.
Having a person doing the business very carefully and barely making mistakes might be one of the best things in any of
team on the world. Logistician can somewhat foresee what is going to happen and it creates more time for team to resolve
the problems.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;">Form a team :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;If I have a chance to build a team on my own based on Myers-Briggs test, I would prefer my
team members to have similar personality types to mine which is logistician. Same personality type of people on the same
team probably would have a better experience, better communication and similar thoughts. Having same type of personality
on the same team could be a good signal, but ideas could be too monotonous. Having some different types of personality
can help me to get a variety of different ideas and aspects which these ideas and aspects I cannot come up with.
Eventually, I would build a team based on same personality type and interspersed with different personality types to have
a better experience, performance or atmosphere.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Project Idea</h2>
<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;">Overview :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;The product is about a smart mirror displayed in the clothing store which contains a variety of functions.
First, after customers decides what clothes, dresses or pants they want, rather than going into fitting rooms, this time,
customers only need to take what they have decided to the mirror. Then the mirror will automatically show what do
customers look like when they dress up. There are two basic ways to tell the smart mirror what you want it to display.
Firstly, each goods contain a special code, like barcode, so all customers have to do is to scan the code. Secondly,
customers can search products on smart mirror and find what they want. Every time I go to clothing store, I spend more
time in the fitting room rather than choosing cloth. But if there is a machine that can displays clothes on my body,
it makes me have more time to browsing. If customers want to try a lot of clothes, they have to put it on and take it off
again and again. Basically, trying clothes on is a time-consuming thing but if there is a mirror can display on
customers’ body, it saves time for them. Smart mirror can save time and let customers having more time on chasing clothes.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;">Motivation :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;Every time when I went to a clothing store, I spent more time in the fitting room trying clothes on than shopping or
deciding what I want in the store. However, if there is a machine that can display how I look like when I dress them up,
it lets me have more time to browsing products. If customers want to try a lot of clothing, they have to dress it up and
take it off again and again. Basically, trying clothes on is a time-consuming thing but if there is a mirror which can
display how customers look like when they wear the clothing they just picked, it saves time for them. Smart mirror can
save time and let customers have more time on choosing clothing.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;">Description :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;A smart mirror is a product that combine mirror and a touchable screen, and this is how it works. To begin with,
a smart mirror contains database that store manager can enter goods into it. For example, enter the product names or
number each time whenever there is new arrival. In addition, when searching products on smart mirror, products can be
searched by names, product numbers or categories, such as clothing, accessories, kicks. It also contains recommendation
for customers based on products they have browsed. After customers pick the clothing they want in the shop, walk to smart
mirror, and then scan the barcode on tag or customers can find it according to category. Customers need to make sure the
whole body is in smart mirror when scanning customers’ body shape for accurately displaying results on the screen. A
benefit of having the smart mirror in the clothing store is if there are any goods that have sold out, customers still
can find the sold-out products on the smart mirror, and have it display the appearance when they dress them up. This
function will not make any customers down because of some hot selling sold out. Furthermore, customer can add what they
want to buy to cart and then do the payment on the machine connected to the smart mirror. This function allows customers
to save time on the steps of picking things, finding matched size and taking desired products to the cashier and checking
out in the store. All these steps can be done in one machine, one place within short amount of time. Moreover,
smart mirror can also recommend customers clothing size according to their body shapes and heights. A smart mirror can
reduce a lot of time for customers. Overall, smart mirror is a wonderful product that can benefit both sides for
customers and shops.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;">Tools and technologies :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;In order to make a smart mirror, firstly it needs a touchable screen. It also needs a scanner to scan code. One of the
most important software is database. In order to successful scan products by customers, data of goods need to be stored
into database to make scanning successfully happen. Another important thing is mirror itself. Payment system and
equipment are also required for a smart mirror.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;">Skills required :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;In order to achieve requirements above, I need to be extremely familiar with database system such as SQLite Studio and
Oracle 18c, because Oracle 18c is an amazing system for users and it allows many users to access at the same time.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;">Outcome :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;Once a smart mirror is successful made, it saves a lot of time for customers and employees. This is because,
    auto-payment reduces a lot of time for customers, and it reduces a ton of works for employees. It increases the
    numbers of customers, and it also makes more profits for stores. However, some employees have a high possibility to
    be replaced by the machine which contains auto-payment function and recommendation of related items function.
    The smart mirror has good sides and downsides for human beings.</p>
